# AEM-Real-Estate-Front-
This is some of the front end code that I wrote during my internship at AEM Real Estate.
I am still new at html, css, and javascript. I hope to improve at them a lot more as time progresses.

# Forms
The first set of code I wrote for AEM. A few forms that would be used by the sales team. A basic set of forms to be filled out. The currency is made to auto-format itself. It will automatically format into the basic USD format for example: 12345 will automatically format into $12,345. The phone number is also set to automatically format itself into the form (123)-456-789.

# Stats Homepage
This is a basic homepage that links to login pages. Footer links work and link to the appropriate website. Pressing the unique clicks percentage will cause a popup message.
I am still learning about how to make my webpage change dynamically depending on the size of the window. Because of this their are issues in the design on certain window sizes.
