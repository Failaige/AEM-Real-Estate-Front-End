# AEM-Real-Estate-Front-
This is some of the front end code that I wrote during my internship at AEM Real Estate.
I am still new at html, css, and javascript. I hope to improve at them a lot more as time progresses.



# Stats Homepage
This is a basic homepage that links to login pages. Footer links work and link to the appropriate website. Pressing the unique clicks percentage will cause a popup message.
I am still learning about how to make my webpage change dynamically depending on the size of the window. Because of this their are issues in the design on certain window sizes.
